        <h2>3.2. Use of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          We may use the Personal Information we collect or receive through the
          Service (alone or in conjunction with other data we source) for the
          purposes and on the legal bases identified below:
        </p>

        <p>
          • To bill and collect money owed to us by you to perform our contact
          with you for the use of the Service or where we have not entered into
          a contract with you, in accordance with our legitimate interests to
          operate and administer our Service. This includes sending you emails,
          invoices, receipts, notices of delinquency, and alerting you if we
          need a different credit card number. We use third parties for secure
          credit card transaction processing, and those third parties collect
          billing information to process your orders and credit card payments.
          To learn more about the steps we take to safeguard that data, see the
          “Our Security” section of this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          • To send you system alert messages in reliance on our legitimate
          interests in administering the Service and providing certain features.
          For example, we may inform you about temporary or permanent changes to
          our Service, such as planned outages, or send you account, security or
          compliance notifications, such as new features, version updates,
          releases, abuse warnings, and changes to this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          • To communicate with you about your account and provide customer
          support to perform our contract with you for the use of the Service or
          where we have not entered into a contract with you, in reliance on our
          legitimate interests in administering and supporting our Service. For
          example, if you use our Mobile Apps, we may ask you if you want to
          receive push notifications about activity in your account. If you have
          opted in to these push notifications and no longer want to receive
          them, you may turn them off through your operating system.
        </p>

        <p>
          • To enforce compliance with our Standard Terms of Use and applicable
          law, and to protect the rights and safety of our Subscribers in
          reliance on our legitimate interest to protect against misuse or abuse
          of our Service and to pursue remedies available. This may include
          developing tools and algorithms that help us prevent violations. For
          example, sometimes we review the content our Subscribers send or
          display to ensure it complies with our Standard Terms of Use. To
          improve that process, we have software that helps us find content that
          may violate our Standard Terms of Use. We may or our third-party
          service provider may also review content that our Subscribers send or
          display. This benefits all Subscribers who comply with our Standard
          Terms of Use because it reduces abuse and helps us maintain a reliable
          platform. Please do not use KreativeRock to send or display
          confidential information.

        <p>

          a contract with you, in reliance on our legitimate interests in

          features. For example, this may include improving the navigation and
          content of the Service and sharing your information with third parties
          in order to provide and support our Service or to make certain
          features of the Service available to you. When we share your Personal

          within our Service that optimize and personalize your experience in
          reliance on our legitimate interests in administering the Service and
          providing certain features. This includes adding features that compare
          Subscribers’ email campaigns, using data to suggest other marketers
          your Contacts may be interested in, or using data to recommend
          products or services that you may be interested in or that may be
          relevant to you or your Contacts. Some of these suggestions are
          generated through analysis of the data used in our data analytics

        <p>
          • To perform data analytics projects in reliance on our legitimate
          business interests in improving and enhancing our products and
          services for our Subscribers. Our data analytics projects use data
          from KreativeRock accounts, including Personal Information of
          Contacts, to provide and improve the Service. We use information like
          your sending habits and your Contacts’ purchase history, so we can
          make more informed predictions, decisions, and products for our
          Subscribers. For example, we use data from KreativeRock accounts to
          enable product recommendation, audience segmentation, and predicted
          demographics features for our Subscribers. If you or your Contact
          prefers not to have their data used for this purpose, you can alter
          the settings on your account to opt out of data analytics projects, or
          your Contact can opt out of data analytics projects at any time. As
          always, we take the privacy of Personal Information seriously, and
          will continue to implement appropriate safeguards to protect this
          Personal Information from misuse or unauthorized disclosure.

          Subscriber's use of the Service in order to create aggregate,

          deliver gifts and promotional materials, marketing information,
          product recommendations, non-transactional communications (e.g.,

          policy, to enable your use of the integrations and plugins you choose

      <div>
        <h2>3.4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
        <p>
          We and our third-party partners may use various technologies to
          collect and store Service Usage Data when you use our Service (as
          discussed above), and this may include using cookies and similar
          tracking technologies. We use this information to measure the
          performance of your online activities on the site, to provide
          analytics information, enhance the effectiveness of our Service, and
          for other purposes described above. Reports are also available to us
          when we send email to you, so we may collect and review that
          information.

      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>3.5. SUBSCRIBER’S DISTRIBUTION LISTS</h2>
        <p>
          • In order to send an email campaign or use certain features in your
          account, you need to upload a Distribution List that provides us
          information about your Contacts, such as their names and email
          addresses. We use and process this information to provide the Service
          in accordance with our contract with you or your organization and this
          privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          • A Distribution List can be created in a number of ways, including by
          importing Contacts, such as indirectly or directly from your email
          client. We do not, under any circumstances, sell your Distribution
          Lists. If someone on your Distribution List complains or contacts us,
          we might then contact that person.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          {" "}
          • If we detect abusive or illegal behavior related to your
          Distribution List, we may share your Distribution List or portions of
          it with Internet Service Providers or anti-spam organizations to the
          extent permitted or required by applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          • If a Contact chooses to use the Forward to a Friend (FTF) link in an
          email campaign a Subscriber sends, it will allow the Contact to share
          the Subscriber’s email content with individuals not on the
          Subscriber’s Distribution List. When a Contact forwards an email to a
          friend, we do not store the Contact’s email address or their friend’s
          email address, and no one is added to any Distribution List as a
          result of the FTF link. The Subscriber who created the email campaign
          only sees an aggregate number of times their email campaign was
          forwarded by a Contact and does not have access to the email addresses
          used to share or receive that forwarded content.
        </p>

        <h2>3.6. YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (2019) and other
          relevant Nigerian laws, regulations or international conventions
          applicable to Nigeria, you have the right:
        </p>
        <p>
          • To access; correct; update; port; delete; restrict; or object to our
          processing of your Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
          • You can manage your individual account and profile settings within
          the dashboard provided through the KreativeRock platform, or you may
          contact us directly by emailing us at info@kreativerock.com. You can
          also manage information about your Contacts within the dashboard
          provided through the KreativeRock platform to assist you with
          responding to requests to access, correct, update, port or delete
          information that you receive from your Contacts. Note, if any of your
          Contacts wish to exercise any of these rights, they should contact you
          directly, or contact us as described in the “Privacy for Contacts”
          section below. You can also contact us at any time to update your own
          marketing preferences. KreativeRock takes reasonable steps to ensure
          that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate,
          complete and up to date.

          Information.

          basis of consent, the data subject can withdraw their consent at any
          time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
          processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect
          the processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on
          lawful processing grounds other than consent. If you receive these
          requests from Contacts, you can segment your lists within the
          KreativeRock platform to ensure that you only market to Contacts who
          have not opted out of receiving such marketing.
