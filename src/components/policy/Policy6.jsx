      <h2>6. GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <h2 className="fst-italics">How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>
        • Our service providers: Sometimes, we share your information with our
        third-party service providers working on our behalf for the purposes
        described in this privacy policy. For example, companies we’ve hired to
        help us provide and support our Service or assist in protecting and
        securing our systems and services and other business-related functions.
        Other examples include analyzing data, hosting data, engaging technical
        support for our Service, processing payments, and delivering content.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        {" "}
        • Advertising partners: We may partner with third-party advertising
        networks, exchanges, and social media platforms (like Google) to display
        advertising on the KreativeRock Sites or to manage and serve our
        advertising on other sites. We and our third-party partners may use
        cookies and other similar tracking technologies, such as pixels and web
        beacons, to gather information about your activities on the KreativeRock
        Sites and other sites in order to provide you with targeted advertising
        based on your browsing activities and interests. In certain cases, we
        may also share limited Personal Information about our Subscribers with
        our third-party advertising partners for our own marketing purposes. If
        you prefer us not to share your Personal Information, you can alter the
        settings on your account.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        {" "}
        • Any competent law enforcement body, regulatory body, government
        agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is
        necessary (a) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (b) to
        exercise, establish, or defend our legal rights, or (c) to protect your
        vital interests or those of any other person. In certain situations, we
        may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful
        requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or
        law enforcement requirements.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        {" "}
        • A potential buyer (and its agents and advisors) in the case of a sale,
        merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganization, or acquisition. In
        that event, any acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this
        privacy policy, including your rights to access and choice. We will
        notify you of the change either by sending you an email or posting a
        notice on our KreativeRock Site.
      </p>{" "}
      <p> • Any other person with your consent.</p>{" "}
      <p>
        {" "}
        • We may also share anonymized, aggregated information with selected
        third parties for statistical or research purposes.
      </p>
      <h2>6.1. YOUR CHOICES AND OPT-OUTS</h2>
      <p>
        • Marketing: Subscribers and Visitors who have opted in to our marketing
        emails can opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time by
        clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of our marketing messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Also, all opt-out requests can be made by emailing us using the contact
        details provided in the "Questions and Concerns" section below.
        <b>
          {" "}
          Please note that some communications (such as service messages,
          account notifications, and billing information) are considered
          transactional and necessary for account management, and Subscribers
          cannot opt out of these messages unless you cancel your KreativeRock
          account.
        </b>
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        {" "}
        • Personalized Advertising: We may share limited Personal Information of
        our Subscribers with third-party advertising networks, exchanges, and
        social media platforms (like Google) to display advertising on the
        KreativeRock Sites or to manage and serve our advertising on other
        sites. If you are a Subscriber and prefer us not to share your Personal
        Information, you can alter the settings on your account.
      </p>
      <h2>6.2. OUR SECURITY</h2>
      <p>
        We take appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational measures
        designed to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized
        access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the
        risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal
        Information.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        {" "}
        KreativeRock accounts require a username and password to log in.
        Subscribers must keep their username and password secure, and never
        disclose it to a third party. Because the information in a Subscriber’s
        KreativeRock account is private, account passwords are hashed, which
        means we cannot see a Subscriber’s password. We cannot resend forgotten
        passwords either. We will only provide Subscribers with instructions on
        how to reset them.
      </p>
      <h2>6.3. COOKIES</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small files placed on your computer’s hard drive that
        enables the website to identify your computer as you view different
        pages. Cookies allow websites and applications to store your preferences
        in order to present contents, options or functions that are specific to
        you. Like most interactive websites, our website uses cookies to enable
        the tracking of your activity for the duration of a session. Our website
        uses only encrypted session cookies which will be erased after a
        predefined period or once the user logs out of the platform and closes
        the browser. Session cookies do not collect information from the user’s
        computer. They will typically store information in the form of a session
        identification that does not personally identify the user.
      </p>
      <h2>6.4. RETENTION OF DATA</h2>
      <p>
        We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate
        business or legal need to do so. Our retention periods will vary
        depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we'll refer to
        these criteria in order to determine retention period:
      </p>
      <p>• Whether we have a legal or contractual need to retain the data.</p>
      <p>• Whether the data is necessary to provide our Service.</p>
      <p>
        • Whether our Subscribers have the ability to access and delete the data
        within their KreativeRock accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Whether our Subscribers would reasonably expect that we would retain
        the data until they remove it or until their KreativeRock accounts are
        closed or terminated.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        {" "}
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this
        is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal
        Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
        possible.
      </p>
      <h2>6.5. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
      <p>
        We may change this privacy policy at any time and from time to time. The
        most recent version of the privacy policy is reflected by the version
        date located at the top of this privacy policy. All updates and
        amendments are effective immediately upon notice, which we may give by
        any means, including, but not limited to, by posting a revised version
        of this privacy policy or other notice on the KreativeRock Sites. We
        encourage you to review this privacy policy often to stay informed of
        changes that may affect you. Our electronically or otherwise properly
        stored copies of this privacy policy are each deemed to be the true,
        complete, valid, authentic, and enforceable copy of the version of this
        privacy policy that was in effect on each respective date you visited
        the KreativeRock Site.
      </p>
      <h2>6.6. QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS</h2>
      <p>

        the way in which we have handled any privacy matter, please send an
        email to{" "}
