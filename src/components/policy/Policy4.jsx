      <h2>4. PRIVACY FOR CONTACTS</h2>
      <p>
        This section applies to the information we process about our
        Subscribers&#8217; Contacts as a data controller. Our Service is
        intended for use by our Subscribers. As a result, for much of the
        Personal Information we collect and process about Contacts through the
        Service, we act as a processor on behalf of our Subscribers.
        KreativeRock is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of
        our Subscribers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy
        policy. Please check with individual Subscribers about the policies they
        have in place. For purposes of this section, "you" and "your" refer to
        Contacts.
      </p>
      <h2>
        a) Information We Collect: The Personal Information that we may collect
        or receive about you broadly falls into the following categories:
      </h2>
      <h2 className="text-center">
        • Information we receive about Contacts from our Subscribers:{" "}
      </h2>
      <p>
        A Subscriber may provide Personal Information about you to us through
        the Service. When a Subscriber uploads their Distribution List or
        integrates the Service with another website or service (for example,
        when a Subscriber chooses to connect their e-commerce account with
        KreativeRock), or when you sign up for a Subscriber&#8217;s Distribution
        List on a KreativeRock or other signup form, the Subscriber may provide
        us with certain contact information or other Personal Information about
        you such as your name, email address, address, or telephone number. You
        may have the opportunity to update some of this information by electing
        to update or manage your preferences via an email you receive from a
        Subscriber.
      </p>
      <h2>• Information we collect automatically: </h2>
      <p>
        When you interact with an email campaign that you receive from a
        Subscriber, browse or purchase from a Subscriber&#8217;s connected
        store, respond to a Subscriber's survey, or otherwise directly interact
        with a Subscriber's use of the Service, we may collect information about
        your device and interaction with the Subscriber's content. We use
        cookies and other tracking technologies to collect some of this
        information.{" "}
      </p>
      <h2>• Device Information: </h2>
      <p>
        We collect information about the device and applications you use to
        access content sent through our Service, such as your IP address, your
        operating system, your browser ID, and other information about your
        system and connection.
      </p>
      <h2>• Usage Data: </h2>
      <p>
        It is important for us to ensure the security and reliability of the
        Service we provide. Therefore, we also collect usage data about your
        interactions with campaigns (and/or emails) and other content delivered
        through the Service, which may include dates and times you access
        campaigns (and/or emails) and your browsing activities (such as what
        pages are viewed, which emails are opened, and how you respond to
        surveys). This information also allows us to provide our Service, ensure
        compliance with our Standard Terms of Use and Acceptable Use Policy, to
        monitor and prevent service abuse, and to ensure we attain certain usage
        standards and metrics in relation to our Service. We also collect
        information regarding the performance of the Service, including metrics
        related to the deliverability of emails and other electronic
        communications that our Subscribers send through the Service. This
        information allows us to improve the content and operation of the
        Service and facilitate research and perform analysis into the use and
        performance of the Service
      </p>
      <h2>• Information we collect from other sources: </h2>
      <p>
        From time to time, we may obtain information about you from third-party
        sources, such as social media platforms, and third-party data providers.
      </p>
      <h2>b) Use of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may use the Personal Information we collect or receive about you in
        reliance on our (and where applicable, our Subscribers&#8217;)
        legitimate interests for the following purposes:
      </p>
      <p>
        • To enforce compliance with our Standard Terms of Use and applicable
        law. This may include utilizing usage data and developing tools and
        algorithms that help us prevent violations.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        • To protect the rights and safety of Subscribers, third parties, or
        KreativeRock. For example, sometimes we review the content of our
        Subscribers&#8217; email campaigns to make sure they comply with our
        Standard Terms of Use. To improve that process, we have software that
        helps us find email campaigns that may violate our Standard Terms of
        Use. We, or our third-party service provider, may review those
        particular email campaigns, which may include your contact information.
        This reduces the amount of spam being sent through our servers and helps
        us maintain high deliverability.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        • To meet legal requirements, including complying with court orders,
        valid discovery requests, valid subpoenas, and other appropriate legal
        mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        • To provide information to representatives and advisors, including
        attorneys and accountants, to help us comply with legal, accounting, or
        security requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        • To prosecute and defend a court, arbitration, or similar legal
        proceeding.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        • To respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet
        national security or law enforcement requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        • To provide, support and improve the Service. For example, this may
        include sharing your information with third parties in order to provide
        and support our Service or to make certain features of the Service
        available to our Subscribers. When we share Personal Information with
        third parties, we take steps to protect your information in a manner
        that is consistent with applicable privacy laws.

        • To perform data analytics projects, our data analytics projects use
        data from KreativeRock accounts, including your Personal Information, to
        provide and improve the Service. We use information, like your purchase
        history, provided to us by Subscribers, so we can make more informed
        predictions, decisions, and products for our Subscribers. For example,
        we use data from KreativeRock accounts to enable product recommendation,
        audience segmentation, and predicted demographics features for our
        Subscribers. If you prefer your data not to be used in this manner, you
        can opt out of data analytics projects at any time.
